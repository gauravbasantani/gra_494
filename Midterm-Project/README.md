# Midterm Project - Acme Solutions

This project focuses on Smart Watches and Solutions offered by "Acme Solutions."

## HTML Semantics and Accessibility Compliance

The HTML structure adheres to semantic elements, such as `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and `<main>`, to enhance accessibility and SEO.

## CSS

I used BEM (Block Element Modifier).

## Typography

The project uses the Montserrat font family from Google Fonts to achieve a consistent and visually appealing typographic style.

## Components and Utility Classes

To streamline styling, the project includes utility classes for flexbox, margin, padding, and display properties.

## Resources Used

- **Google Fonts:** The 'Inter' font family from Google Fonts is employed for typography consistency.
- **YouTube Embed:** A YouTube video is embedded to showcase introductory content.
- **FreePik:** Some of the images used in the project are sourced from FreePik.
- **Coolors:** The color palette for the design is generated using Coolors.
